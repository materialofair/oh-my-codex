# Deep Search Mode


## Native Subagent Protocol (Codex)

Codex supports native subagents. Delegate with `spawn_agent`, coordinate with `send_input`, collect via `wait`, and clean up with `close_agent`.

Execution preference:
1. Use native subagents first for independent workstreams (parallel when possible).
2. Merge results in main thread and run final verification.
3. Fallback only when delegation is blocked: use the `[ANALYST]`/`[ARCHITECT]`/`[EXECUTOR]`/`[REVIEWER]` structure in a single response.

Minimal orchestration pattern:
```text
spawn_agent -> send_input (optional) -> wait -> close_agent
```

> Codex invocation: use `$deepsearch ...` or `deepsearch: ...`


[DEEPSEARCH MODE ACTIVATED]

## Objective

Perform thorough search of the codebase for the specified query, pattern, or concept.

## Search Strategy

1. **Broad Search**
   - Search for exact matches
   - Search for related terms and variations
   - Check common locations (components, utils, services, hooks)

2. **Deep Dive**
   - Read files with matches
   - Check imports/exports to find connections
   - Follow the trail (what imports this? what does this import?)

3. **Synthesize**
   - Map out where the concept is used
   - Identify the main implementation
   - Note related functionality

## Output Format

- **Primary Locations** (main implementations)
- **Related Files** (dependencies, consumers)
- **Usage Patterns** (how it's used across the codebase)
- **Key Insights** (patterns, conventions, gotchas)

Focus on being comprehensive but concise. Cite file paths and line numbers.
