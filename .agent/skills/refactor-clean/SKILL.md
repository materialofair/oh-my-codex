# Refactor Clean


## Native Subagent Protocol (Codex)

Codex supports native subagents. Delegate with `spawn_agent`, coordinate with `send_input`, collect via `wait`, and clean up with `close_agent`.

Execution preference:
1. Use native subagents first for independent workstreams (parallel when possible).
2. Merge results in main thread and run final verification.
3. Fallback only when delegation is blocked: use the `[ANALYST]`/`[ARCHITECT]`/`[EXECUTOR]`/`[REVIEWER]` structure in a single response.

Minimal orchestration pattern:
```text
spawn_agent -> send_input (optional) -> wait -> close_agent
```

Safely identify and remove dead code with test verification:

1. Run dead code analysis tools:
   - knip: Find unused exports and files
   - depcheck: Find unused dependencies
   - ts-prune: Find unused TypeScript exports

2. Generate comprehensive report in .reports/dead-code-analysis.md

3. Categorize findings by severity:
   - SAFE: Test files, unused utilities
   - CAUTION: API routes, components
   - DANGER: Config files, main entry points

4. Propose safe deletions only

5. Before each deletion:
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify tests pass
   - Apply change
   - Re-run tests
   - Rollback if tests fail

6. Show summary of cleaned items

Never delete code without running tests first!
