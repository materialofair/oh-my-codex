# start-dev - Intelligent Workflow with Smart Pattern Loading

## Native Subagent Protocol (Codex)

Codex supports native subagents. Delegate with `spawn_agent`, coordinate with `send_input`, collect via `wait`, and clean up with `close_agent`.

Execution preference:
1. Use native subagents first for independent workstreams (parallel when possible).
2. Merge results in main thread and run final verification.
3. Fallback only when delegation is blocked: use the `[ANALYST]`/`[ARCHITECT]`/`[EXECUTOR]`/`[REVIEWER]` structure in a single response.

Minimal orchestration pattern:
```text
spawn_agent -> send_input (optional) -> wait -> close_agent
```

Codex subagent profile mapping:
- `code-explorer` intent -> `agent_type: explorer`
- `code-architect` / `code-reviewer` / `code-executor` intents -> `agent_type: worker` with role-specific prompt
- Parallel fan-out: spawn multiple agents, then `wait` and synthesize in main thread

> Codex invocation: use `start-dev: ...` or `$start-dev ...`

Execute complete Research → Plan → Implement workflow with **automatic pattern library loading** and intelligent codebase understanding.

## Usage

## 🆕 NEW: Automatic Pattern Library Loading

The workflow now **automatically detects task type** and loads relevant pattern libraries:

### Task Type Detection

**Frontend Keywords** (auto-loads `frontend-patterns`):
- UI, 界面, 组件, 页面, 表单, 前端
- React, Vue, Angular, 样式, CSS
- 用户交互, 动画, 响应式, 布局
- Component, Hook, State, Props

**Backend Keywords** (auto-loads `backend-patterns`):
- API, 接口, 服务, 数据库, 后端
- 认证, 授权, 中间件, 缓存
- Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Authentication, Authorization, Middleware

**Full-Stack Keywords** (loads both):
- 全栈, 完整功能, 端到端, full-stack
- 前后端, 整体实现, complete feature

### Pattern Loading Process

```
Step 0: Task Analysis
